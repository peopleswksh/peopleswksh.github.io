<li>UPDATE: COLING’2020 IS GOING ENTIRELY VIRTUAL! All parts of the conference programme will involve a mixture of virtual presentations and real-time Q/A sessions.
PEOPLES will be virtual also!</li>
<li>IMPORTANT UPDATE: Please note that the workshop has been postponed to 13th December and 
	the submission deadline is now extended, in accordance with <a href="https://coling2020.org/" target="_blank">COLING 2020</a> being postponed to December.</li>	
<li>Keynote: <a href="http://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu">David Jurgens</a>, University of Michigan, US</li>
<li>The workshop will be held on December 13, 2020 at COLING in Barcelona</li>

<p>
On social media, users nowadays freely express what is on their mind at any moment in time, at any location, 
and about virtually anything. These large amounts of spontaneously produced texts open up a unique opportunity to learn more about social 
media  users,  e.g.,  predicting socio-demographic variables (age, gender, profession, education), personality types, 
as well as emotions and opinion expressions. Indeed, this excellent opportunity has materialized in a large and 
growing number of recent workshops held at different Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, 
Semantic Web, and Information Retrieval venues, for example WASSA (focusing on sentiment and social media), 
PAN (focusing on author profiling like personality) and ESSEM (focusing on emotions in AI), including 
the organization of shared tasks such asat SemEval with a special sentiment track. However, such aspects of 
human personality and behavior have been mostly studied in isolation, often in different—but related—communities.

PEOPLES aims at bringing these diverse communities a step closer to each other, to study people's 
traits and expressions jointly and in their interplay.</p>

<p>
Indeed, the traits in the focus of PEOPLES can be seen as characterizing the whole person and should be studied together.   
Contextually,  one  should  study  how  their  interaction, and their computational modelling impact both natural 
language processing and society. This also in view of recent active discussions regarding ethical and bias-related 
aspects in NLP, which strongly relate to the traits that the PEOPLES workshop focuses on.</p>
<p>
<!--While it is evident that interest is wide and high, it is also evident that such aspects of human personality and behavior have been mostly studied in isolation, often in different - but related - communities. We believe that the time is ripe to bring these communities a step closer, to study people’s traits and expressions jointly and in their interplay.
<p>
On a conceptual level we can view these aspects on a continuum of stability, where some can be considered stable (e.g., gender), while others are of more transitional nature and contextually prompted (e.g., emotions). They can be seen as characterizing traits of the whole person and should be studied together. As of now, however, little is known on how they interact with one another in computational language understanding, how they interact, and how they impact both natural language processing and society.

<p> PEOPLES 2020 would be the continuation of successful editions that were held at COLING 2016 and NAACL 2018, 
by continuing to provide a forum for researchers who share an interest in personality, opinion and emotion detection, 
as well as the impact of this work on society.</p>
	
<p>
We will encourage the submission of long (9 pages) and short (4 pages) research papers, including opinion statements.  
We will especially welcome views from different fields, and will welcome submissions related but not limited to the 
following topics:</p>

<ul>
<li> opinion, personality and emotion detection in social media
<li> opinions, personality and emotions and their interactions
<li> interaction between personality, opinion and emotions with socio-demographic variables
<li> interaction between personality, opinion and emotions and geo-spatial information
<li> interaction between socio-demographic, personality, opinion and emotions with politics
<li> analysis of social networks with attributes (e.g.  socio-demographic attributes or opinions)
<li> modeling of personality, opinion and emotions from a multimodal perspective
<li> multilingual approaches to demographic inference from social media 
<li> multilingual approaches to opinion, emotions and personality detection
<li> cross-cultural analysis of opinion, emotions, personality in multilingual social media data
<li> applications of predictive modeling of user traits
<li> bias-related issues, and the ethics of predictive modeling of user attributes
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red">UPDATE</span>: We also very much welcome research that focuses on 
how the usual PEOPLES dimensions might have changed or might be changing due to the special COVID-related circumstances. 
For example, how relevant traits might be represented differently now with respect to 'normal' times.</p>
